<h3 class="bold">14. Background Check Process</h3>
<p>Please read before completing fingerprinting process.</p>
<p>Lincoln Glen Nursing Facility completes a background check on all employees. 
Unfortunately, we understand that this may eliminate potentially great employees 
from being hired as some of us have things in our past,
even from a long time ago. Sometimes it has been so long we have forgotten or 
think that it may not be
revealed.</p>
<p>The Law</p>
<p>The California Health and Safety Code requires a background check of all 
applicants, licensees, adult residents, volunteers under certain conditions and 
employees of community care facilities who have contact with clients. If the 
California Department of Social Services finds that an individual has been 
convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation, the individual cannot 
work or be present in any community care facility unless they receive a criminal 
record exemption from the Community Care Licensing Division, Caregiver 
Background Check Bureau (CBCB). Simply defined, an exemption is a Department 
authorized written document that exempts the individual from the requirement 
of having a criminal record clearance. CBCB also examines arrest records to 
determine if there is a possible danger to clients (Health &amp; Safety Code 
sections 1522, 1568.08, 1569.17, and 1596.871).<br>
</p>
<p>How the Background Check is Conducted</p>
<p>When an individual submits fingerprints, the California Department of Justice 
(DOJ) conducts a background check. If the individual has no criminal history, 
DOJ will forward a clearance notice to the applicant or licensee and to CBCB. If 
the individual has a criminal history, DOJ will send a criminal record 
transcript to CBCB. The transcript will show arrests and convictions. CBCB staff 
will review the transcript and if the convictions are for crimes that can be 
exempted, CBCB will send an exemption notification letter to the applicant or 
licensee and to the individual.<br>
</p>
<p>All convictions other than minor traffic violations, including misdemeanors, 
felonies and convictions that occurred a long time ago require an exemption. 
However, individuals convicted of serious crimes such as robbery, sexual 
battery, child abuse, elder or dependent adult abuse, rape, arson or kidnapping 
are not eligible for an exemption. Lincoln Glen will not offer exemptions for 
new hires at this time.</p>
<p>The Department of Social Services is prohibited by law from granting exemptions 
to individuals convicted of certain crimes and provides a current list of 
Non-Exemptible Crimes.</p>
<p>Please review this information and let us know if you would like us to halt the 
hiring process. No questions will be asked. You may call or email us and request 
that we withdrawal your application if you believe that you are not going to be 
eligible for employment due to events that may be revealed through the 
background check.<br>
</p>
<p>We hope that you find this information helpful. Thank you for your 
understanding.</p>
